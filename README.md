# Media-Research
A Project Me and my teammate created to research the effects of media social
especially on the mental well being of users by comparing data from the amount
of time use to the number of attention given by each user.

I did the back-end as well as checking notes to see if anything was false while
my partner did the analysis code. we both did the report together
